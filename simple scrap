These below lines are containg the info related to scraping atozmp3.info wesite.

I did this under simple scrapy shell command:
command : scrapy shell "http://atozmp3.info/category/telugu/"
it'll creates response variable and we need to perform below operations on the particuulr variable.

Here every thing done with the help of css only.
Imp:
    -> if something is class name it should start with . symbol
    -> if it is a tag update them in hierarchial manner
       ex: .entry p strong span::text
            entry is a class, under this p is a tag, under this strong is one momre tag,
            under this span is one more tag, to fetch text from that tag use text.
    -> use extract method to avoid the tags in output.
    -> In a particular tag, if there is more than one variable, use attr method to get the
       valure of the particular symbol.
       Ex: 
          .post-title a:attr(title)
          from post-title class under a tag fetch the value of the title attribute.

<=====================================================================>
for out in response.css('.post'):
    print "Movie :", out.css('.post-title a::attr(title)')[0].extract()
    for i in out.css('.entry p strong span::text').extract():
        print i
    print '*' * 20
